#1. Suppose a homogeneous array with 6 rows and 8 columns is stored in row major order starting at address 20 (base ten). If each entry in the array requires only one memory cell, what is the address of the entry in the third row and fourth column? What if each entry requires two memory cells?#2. What complications are imposed if one tries to implement a dynamic list using a traditional homogeneous array?#3. Describe a method for storing three-dimensional homogeneous arrays. What addressing formula would be used to locate the entry in the ith plane, jth row, and the kth column?#4. Does a queue crawl through memory in the direction of its head or its tail? Explain your answer.
